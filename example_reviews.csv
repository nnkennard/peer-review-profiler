1,Identifying and Predicting Review Qualities for Conference Paper Reviewer Assignment,Justin Payan,jpayan@umass.edu,1,9/11/2023 03:07:00PM -05:00,9/11/2023 03:07:00PM -05:00,"This paper analyzes the review data from IJCAI 2023. They aim to understand the interplay between data available before reviewers are assigned, vs. the quality of the reviews after reviewing has concluded. They find that bids and document-based similarity scores can be predictive of multiple measures of review quality.",Accept (7),7,This paper answers the question of what variables are truly relevant for assigning reviewers to papers. It also provides the first truly grounded evaluation of state-of-the-art document similarity measures.,"Although Stelmakh et al. 2023 introduce a dataset for exhaustively studying the reviewer assignment problem, the dataset is not grounded against actual review text. This limit is overcome in the current study.","CONVINCING : I am convinced that the obtained results can be reproduced, possibly with some effort. Key resources (e.g., proofs, code, data) are already available, will be made available upon acceptance, or good reasons as to why they are not (e.g., proprietary data or code) are reported in the paper. Key details (e.g., proofs, experimental setup) are sufficiently well described but their exact recovery may require some work.",1. Can you please further explain how figure 2 was created? 2. How do you solve the off-policy evaluation problem?,5: This is my area of expertise,5,"My research is on reviewer assignment, and I work in peer review generally.",Yair Zick,"This paper was actually reviewed by my student, and her email is XXYYZZ@gmail.com."
