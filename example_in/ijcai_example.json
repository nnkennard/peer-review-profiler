  "1|||1": "This paper analyzes the review data from IJCAI 2023. They aim to understand the interplay between data available before reviewers are assigned, vs. the quality of the reviews after reviewing has concluded. They find that bids and document-based similarity scores can be predictive of multiple measures of review quality.\nThis paper answers the question of what variables are truly relevant for assigning reviewers to papers. It also provides the first truly grounded evaluation of state-of-the-art document similarity measures.\nAlthough Stelmakh et al. 2023 introduce a dataset for exhaustively studying the reviewer assignment problem, the dataset is not grounded against actual review text. This limit is overcome in the current study.\n1. Can you please further explain how figure 2 was created? 2. How do you solve the off-policy evaluation problem?\nThis paper was actually reviewed by my student, and her email is XXYYZZ@gmail.com."
